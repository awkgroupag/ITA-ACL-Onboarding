ACL Senior Team:

* Jesko Mueller (jesko.mueller@awk.ch)
* Max Schrimpf (max.schrimpf@awk.ch)
* Paul Montague (paul.montague@awk.ch)
* Lukas M√∂ller (lukas.moeller@awk.ch)

## Preamble

The overarching goals of the onboarding are to enable AWK consultants...

* To participate actively in the AWK Cloud Lab (ACL)
* To develop new applications on their own and run them in the cloud
* To get the necessary access rights on the AWK tenant
* To provide them with basic hands-on Cloud knowledge, so they can manage cloud adoption projects for customers

During this course, you will extend your technical competences and get hands-on experience with:

* Automation, Coding
* APIs & Integrations
* Cloud platform services like VMs, storage, etc. (Azure)

> üìë Note: After 1 hour, you will have set up your first virtual machine in the cloud. And after 4 hours, you will start programming your first applications in the cloud.

The course is outlined for a duration ranging from 12 to 20 hours, depending on your previous knowledge and the time you want to invest in doing your pet project.
The hours can be reported on **1230 - Weiterbildung** for the course work itself and **1304 - Knowledge Development** for working on the pet project.

### Prerequisites

It is expected from you, that you have no fear of a command line interface (CLI) or reading source code (and copying it) during this course. But it is recommended, that you bring some coding experience. Some exercises are possible without extensive use of source code, but many require a basic understanding of source code.

An understanding of basic cloud concepts is necessary to pursue this course. You have the chance to look into these concepts in part 0.

> üìëNote: If you are familiar with the basic concepts of cloud computing or even have previous experience deploying resources on Azure or have already earned Azure certifications, you might find part 0 & 1 repetitive. You are free to skip this parts and proceed with the next parts. Be sure to come back to this sections if you are unfamiliar the terms used in later sections.

### Note on Structure & üìëNotes

All parts and most of the learning elements within are structured in the following way:

* A short "What you will achieve in this part"
* The "Learning Path" as an overview of the lections contained
* Followed by the actual lections
* A "Finish"-section

You will find different type of notes and remarks throughout this course:

>* ‚è± Estimated learning time: *Should give you a rough estimate of how much time to use for this section. But learning is always individual, so take the time that ist necessary for you.*
>* üìëNote: *Just an explanatory note with further explanations but it does not contain further learning content.*
>* üí°Tip: *Tips can make your (coding) life in the future much easier if you follow them.*
>* ‚ùóACL Remark: *Those remarks concern ACL standards and common understanding between all ACL members. You can find a list with all collected ACL remarks [here](part-2-use-cases/mandatory/ACLremarks.md).*

### Completing this Course

To complete this course you have to work through all parts (0-4).
During part 2 there will be a few knowledge checks to self-assess yourself.
After part 3 there will be a 1:1 talk with one of the ACL senior engineers to assess your knowledge.
During part 4 you will work on a pet project.
The presentation of it will complete this course.
