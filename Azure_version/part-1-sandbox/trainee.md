# Become an ACL trainee <!-- omit in toc -->

Contact [Lukas Möller](mailto:lukas.moeller@awk.ch) or Jesko Mueller to become an ACL trainee.

You will receive access to AWK Azure ressources and will have a budget of CHF 50 / month for setting up small automations and proceeding with the course.

> 📑 Note: Please keep in mind that cloud ressources are payed as pay-as-you-go. Therefore, shut down ressources that you do not need anymore to save money.
