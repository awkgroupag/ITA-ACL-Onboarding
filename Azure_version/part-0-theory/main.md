# Part 0: Theoretical basis <!-- omit in toc -->

## What you will achieve in this part <!-- omit in toc -->

* Basic understanding of Cloud Computing concepts
* Common language, terms and definitions inside ACL

> üìë Note: If you are familiar with the basic concepts of cloud computing or even have previous experience deploying resources on Azure or have already earned Azure certifications, you might find this part repetitive. You are free to skip this part and proceed with the next part. Be sure to come back to this section if you are unfamiliar with the terms used in later sections.

## AWK Cloud Services & Infrastructure Foundation Course

> ‚è± Estimated time: 4 hours

Visit the internal AWK course **Cloud Services & Infrastructure Foundation**. You can choose a date and register [on LMS](https://lm01.awkgroup.com/LmsSui/Catalog.aspx?id=10571&parentId=10694&BackUrl=%2FLmsSui%2FCatalog.aspx%3FstartSearch%3Dtrue%26searchParam%3Dcloud). The course documentation can be found [here](http://awkgroup.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/ORG-KHMGMT-Learning/courses/EtC0VZk4pedDrZ6E6qBiu0ABJsYoFci1ti1AMwhFlZTfrg?e=6wRojd).

## AZ-900 Azure Cloud Fundamentals

> ‚è± Estimated time: 10 to 15 hours

Alternatively (or additionally), you can follow the [Azure certification path](https://lm01.awkgroup.com/LmsSui/Catalog.aspx?id=10704&parentId=10694&BackUrl=%2FLmsSui%2FCatalog.aspx%3FstartSearch%3Dtrue%26searchParam%3Dazure%20learning) and start with the first Azure certification [AZ-900 Azure Cloud Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900). This option might be more suited, as the live course can only be offered on 4 occasions each year.

Additionally, if you follow the learning path provided by Microsoft and work on the sandboxes available in it, you get a head start for the next part.

It is not necessary to take and pass the certification in order to proceed with this course, but it is recommended. Either way, it is more important that you have understood the concepts and are familiar with the terms most commonly used in Azure.

## Online Crash Course on Cloud Computing

### ACL Lab Week variant - Trainee

> ‚è±Estimated time: 0.5 hours

As some of you might wanna right-away start with the coding part of this course and do not have the time to prepare for the AZ-900 certification, we want to provide a possibility to proceed after a crash course on cloud computing.

* If you prefer videos: [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M988_fsOSWo) (6min) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWgW-CgdIk0) (20min, a little more exhaustive but covering similar topics)
* If you prefer reading: [Microsoft course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/fundamental-azure-concepts/)
* If you prefer PPT: [Work through the course slides of our internal course on your own](http://awkgroup.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/ORG-KHMGMT-Learning/courses/EtC0VZk4pedDrZ6E6qBiu0ABJsYoFci1ti1AMwhFlZTfrg?e=6wRojd)

**BUT** be reminded that this is only a merely sufficient fallback solution. We strongly recommend to catch up with one of the other two alternatives later on if you want to continue with cloud computing. This is necessary to be able to put cloud solutions in the correct context and perspective in your future work.

Proceed with [Part 1: First steps in Azure](../part-1-sandbox/main.md) from here on.

### ACL Lab Week variant - Fun

> ‚è±Estimated time: 0.25 hours

As some of you might wanna right-away start with trying some cool stuff in the cloud. We want to be sure, that everyone has a basic understanding what we mean, when we talk about Cloud computing. To start:

* Either have [a short read](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/what-is-cloud-computing)
* or [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M988_fsOSWo) (6min) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWgW-CgdIk0) (20min, a little more exhaustive but covering similar topics)

Proceed with the [Power Platform tuorial](../part-2-use-cases/optional/power-platform.md) from here on.
