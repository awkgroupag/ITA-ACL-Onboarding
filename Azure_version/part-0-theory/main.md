## Cloud Services & Infrastructure Foundation Course

> ‚è± Estimated time: 4 hours

Visit the internal AWK course **Cloud Services & Infrastructure Foundation**. You can choose a date and register [on LMS](https://lm01.awkgroup.com/LmsSui/Catalog.aspx?id=10571&parentId=10694&BackUrl=%2FLmsSui%2FCatalog.aspx%3FstartSearch%3Dtrue%26searchParam%3Dcloud). The course documentation can be found [here](http://awkgroup.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/ORG-KHMGMT-Learning/courses/EtC0VZk4pedDrZ6E6qBiu0ABJsYoFci1ti1AMwhFlZTfrg?e=6wRojd).

## AZ-900 Azure Cloud Fundamentals

> ‚è± Estimated time: 10 to 15 hours

Alternatively (or additionally), you can follow the [Azure certification path](https://lm01.awkgroup.com/LmsSui/Catalog.aspx?id=10704&parentId=10694&BackUrl=%2FLmsSui%2FCatalog.aspx%3FstartSearch%3Dtrue%26searchParam%3Dazure%20learning) and start with the first Azure certification [AZ-900 Azure Cloud Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900). This option might be more suited, as the live course can only be offered on 4 occasions each year.

Additionally, if you follow the learning path provided by Microsoft and work on the sandboxes available in it, you get a head start for the next part.

It is not necessary to take and pass the certification in order to proceed with this course, but it is recommended. Either way, it is more important that you have understood the concepts and are familiar with the terms most commonly used in Azure.
