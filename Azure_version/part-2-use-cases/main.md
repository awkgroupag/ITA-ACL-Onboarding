# Part 2: Introduction to Use Cases (Title TODO)

## What you will achieve in this part

* Development environment is ready to use
* Try out resource deployments of use cases most commonly used inside ACL
* Make decisions about sizing, scaling and type of resources
* Know where to look for further knowledge and whom to ask

## Learning Path

### Basic GitHub Knowledge

Do you have experience in modern version control for code? Do you know what git repository, commit, branch, merge request and issue are?

* Yes  --> Skip this section.
* No --> Check this [course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) out.
* I am not sure --> The above course takes less than 1 hour

### Setup development environment

You can set up your local development environment with these [Instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/prepare-your-dev-environment-for-azure-development/)

We recommend that you choose Visual Studio Code (vscode) as it's the ACL default and we can provide support if needed.

Further alternatives are
* Online development with [vscode online](https://vscode.dev/)
* Jump host idea (pay as you go) [❌ TODO]
