# Logic Apps

Description:
Azure Logic Apps is a platform for creating and running automated workflows (similar to PowerAutomate) that integrate your apps, data, services, and systems.
You can create processes with business logic and integrate other systems that can be run as automated workflows.
Many connectors are available, so that you can use all sort of APIs and connect to different data sources and applications.

You do not need any coding know-how as logic app is a low-code platform.
