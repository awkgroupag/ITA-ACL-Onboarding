# ACL Remarks from part 1

> ❗ACL Remark: Inside ACL, we follow a naming concept for resources.
> It can be found [here](/TODO.md).
> All resource names should follow a certain pattern *loga-example-purpose*, where the name should start with a 3-4 letter acronym of the resource type followed by the purpose of the resource.

> ❗ACL Remark: Inside ACL, we follow a tagging concept for resources.
> It can be found [here](/TODO.md).
> All resource resources must have an *owner* (email of the owner) and an *environment* (*prod* for production, *dev* for development) tag.

> ❗ACL Remark: Inside ACL, we put resource locks on every resource that serves a productive workload.

> ❗ACL Remark: Inside ACL, we follow a naming concept for resource groups.
> It can be found [here](/TODO.md).
> All resource group names should follow a certain pattern *rg-euwe-pr-example-purpose*, where the name should start with *rg* followed by the Azure region (see below), a tag for the environment (pr: production, dev: development) and the purpose.

> ❗ACL Remark: Inside ACL we mostly use *West Europe* or *North Europe* as Azure region.
