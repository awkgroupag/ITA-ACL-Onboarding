# Part 4: Do your own pet project

## What you will achieve in this part

* ❌ TODO

> 📝 Note: *All working hours on the pet project can be reported on **1304 - Knowledge Development***.

## Learning Path

Now you should have the necessary base concepts to work on your own project. We have collected a few ideas [here](https://awkgroup.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/DIV-AWKCloudLab-6403109Z/Freigegebene%20Dokumente/General/02_Applications/01_Application_Proposals.pptx?d=w8b0a37320fc8434998a442190e2025b7&csf=1&web=1&e=pEU91c). You can choose one of those or come up with an own idea. For the latter, we recommend a short discussion with one of the ACL senior engineers to discuss the size and fit.

Independent of your choice, your first step, as a cloud developer, should be to draw an overview of the architecture. This should include (at least):

* one view that shows the services that are used and how they are linked to each other
* one view that shows the data flows and stores (inputs / outputs / DBs)

As soon as you have this architectural overview, talk to an ACL senior engineer. He / she could give you ssome ideas that will make your life a lot easier!

Now you're ready to roll! Let the **>_** begin.

## Finish

You successfully finished this course. You can now become an ACL junior engineer 🎉. To do so follow [these instructions](engineer.md).
