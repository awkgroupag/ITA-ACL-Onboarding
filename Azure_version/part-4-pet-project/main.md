# Part 4: Do your own pet project

## What will you achieve in this part

* TODO

Note: All hours of the pet project can be reported on 1304 - Knowledge Development.

## Learning Path

Now you should be enabled to do your own project. We have collected a few ideas [here](TOOD). You can choose one of those or come up with an own idea. For the latter we recommend a short discussion with one of the ACL senior engineers to discuss the size.

## Finish

You successfully finished this course. You can now become an ACL junior engineer. To do so follow [this instruction](TODO)
