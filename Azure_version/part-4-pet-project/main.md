# Part 4: Do your own pet project

## What will you achieve in this part

* TODO

Note: *All hours of the pet project can be reported on **1304 - Knowledge Development***.

## Learning Path

Now you should be enabled to do your own project. We have collected a few ideas [here](https://awkgroup.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/DIV-AWKCloudLab-6403109Z/Freigegebene%20Dokumente/General/02_Applications/01_Application_Proposals.pptx?d=w8b0a37320fc8434998a442190e2025b7&csf=1&web=1&e=pEU91c). You can choose one of those or come up with an own idea. For the latter we recommend a short discussion with one of the ACL senior engineers to discuss the size and fit.

## Finish

You successfully finished this course. You can now become an ACL junior engineer. To do so follow [this instruction](TODO)
