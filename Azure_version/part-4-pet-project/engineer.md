# Become an ACL engineer <!-- omit in toc -->

When you have reached this point, you have finished the ACL Onboarding course! Congratulations and welcome on board in the ACL-Team.

Contact [Lukas Möller](mailto:lukas.moeller@awk.ch) or Jesko Mueller to become an ACL engineer.

You will get access to AWK Azure ressources for production and will have a budget of CHF 100 / month for setting up automations and pursuing new project on your own.

> 📑 Note: Please keep in mind that cloud ressources are payed as pay-as-you-go. Therefore, shut down ressources that you do not need anymore to save money.
